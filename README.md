- ⚡ Fun fact: For several years I was a political lobbyist and campaigner for charities and NGOs in the UK and I remember participating an 'ambush' of government officials with a group of people holding up artworks of their genitalia at a Sexual Health Conference to highlight how sexual health education isn't just procreation education.
