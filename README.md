# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Git

### My name is Duy Hoang and I'm an avid Scala Engineer aiming to specialise in Concurrency, Functional Effectual Programing & Big Data ML Models.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on refining my application building workflow
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about integrating and utilising Kafka in my applications
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m starting up a Functional Programming group on Meetup alongside some Clojure, Elm & Haskell Engineers (:eyes: this space)
- :love_letter: I'm starting up a blog documenting some standout topics for future wannabe Scala Engineers (:eyes: this space)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for feedback
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: duyh1815@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: For several years I was a political lobbyist and campaigner for charities and NGOs in the UK and I remember participating an 'ambush' of government officials with a group of people holding up artworks of their genitalia at a Sexual Health Conference to highlight how sexual health education isn't just procreation education.
